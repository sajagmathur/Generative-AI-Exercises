Python Courses
Course 1: AI Python for Beginners

Module 1: Basics of AI Python
What is a Programming Language?
Write instructions that tells computer what to do. You have done the basics
AI_Python Folder
1_basic_programs : Gives some basic programs in python
2_data_types : Explains the types of data in Python including strings (text), integers (int), float, finding type of datasets, multi line strings and some basic arithmatic in python
3_formatted_strings: use f strings to combine strings and calculations.
4_Variables: Relating to variables to be used in python. That variable names are case sensitive in python
5_Building LLM prompts with variables: Helps in building LLM prompts with the help of variables.
6_Using_Functions: There is another function exercise that helps using functions. 

Module 2: Automation using Python
7_Lists and Automation: Introduces lists and how python can help automating tasks
8_Repeated tasks with for loops: Introduces repeating tasks with for loops. Challenge with list: it is difficult to figur out which item is where. Solved by dictionaries
9_Prioritizing_Tasks_With_Dictionaries: Using dictionaries to do high priority, then medium priority and then low priority tasks
10_Customizing_Data_With_Dictionaries: Customized receipe using prompt
11_Compare_Values_In_Python: Using boolean variables to compare data in python and calculate say which number is bigger etc.

12_Make_Decisions_Based_On_Variables: Using if else statements to do only tasks that take less than a particular amount of time. Understood usage of if else as well as for loops.

13_Highlights_Using_LLM: Read a file and highlight relevant data. Get HTML response.

Module 3: Using your own data and documents in python

14_Using_Files_In_Python: Using python to write text files or read text files and extract insights

15_Loading_Using_Own_Data: Load your own data and ask LLM to summarize it or do particular things with it

16_Reading_Food_Critic_Journals: Use journal entries from food critics, process it and classify it based on relevance.

17_Extract_Restaurant_Info: Extract particular information from Restaurant and use that.

Course 2: Introduction to Machine Learning

Introduction to ML:

AI has two types:
 - Strong AI / Artificial General Intelligence: Mimicing every activity that human brain does. Eg. Robotics.
 - Weak AI or Narrow AI: Solve one problem at a time. For Example: Detection of cancer in patients. ML comes under weak AI


 Deep Learning is the sub part of ML. This is more advance algorithms.

 Objective of ML is to understand patterns, learn and give some outcomes. For example: Learn from symptoms and come to conclusion of what disease you have. Thus, ML includes pattern recognition.

 Why is it Important?

 Because it can help solve complex problems that humans cant solve alone. It helps in predictions with massive amount of computational abilities.

 What is important:
 Right Training Data, Right Algorithm

 Types of ML
 Supervised Learning - with labels
  - Classification: Cssification into particular buckets: eg. Default / No Default
  - Regression: Need to predict particular values
 Unsupervised Learning - without labels
  - Clustering 
  - Association (Market Basket analysis etc.)
