Module 1: Basics of AI Python
What is a Programming Language?
Write instructions that tells computer what to do. You have done the basics
AI_Python Folder
1_basic_programs : Gives some basic programs in python
2_data_types : Explains the types of data in Python including strings (text), integers (int), float, finding type of datasets, multi line strings and some basic arithmatic in python
3_formatted_strings: use f strings to combine strings and calculations.
4_Variables: Relating to variables to be used in python. That variable names are case sensitive in python
5_Building LLM prompts with variables: Helps in building LLM prompts with the help of variables.
6_Using_Functions: There is another function exercise that helps using functions. 

Module 2: Automation using Python
7_Lists and Automation: Introduces lists and how python can help automating tasks
8_Repeated tasks with for loops: Introduces repeating tasks with for loops. Challenge with list: it is difficult to figur out which item is where. Solved by dictionaries
9_Prioritizing_Tasks_With_Dictionaries: Using dictionaries to do high priority, then medium priority and then low priority tasks
10_Customizing_Data_With_Dictionaries: Customized receipe using prompt
11_Compare_Values_In_Python: Using boolean variables to compare data in python and calculate say which number is bigger etc.

12_Make_Decisions_Based_On_Variables: Using if else statements to do only tasks that take less than a particular amount of time. Understood usage of if else as well as for loops.

13_Highlights_Using_LLM: Read a file and highlight relevant data. Get HTML response.

Module 3: Using your own data and documents in python

14_Using_Files_In_Python: Using python to write text files or read text files and extract insights

15_Loading_Using_Own_Data: Load your own data and ask LLM to summarize it or do particular things with it

16_Reading_Food_Critic_Journals: Use journal entries from food critics, process it and classify it based on relevance.

17_Extract_Restaurant_Info: Extract particular information from Restaurant and use that.

18_Vacation_Planning_CSV: Extracts data from CSV file and use data to derive meaningful information

19_Functions: Using functions to do a lot of stuff

20_Looping_In_Gen_AI: Creating a detailed Itinerary of different cities using Gen AI.

Module 4: Extending Python with Packages and APIs
How to use python packages. Basic introduction of what API does and how to use other people's work.

21_Using_Functions_From_Local_File: Just tells how import works

22_Built_In_Packages: Explores pythons built in packages.
 
23_Using_Third_Party_Packages: Use packages like pandas and matplotlib.

24_Install_Package: Install packages like beautifulsoup and aisetup and use them

25_API_To_Get_Data: Using different model's open AI apis to use it.
