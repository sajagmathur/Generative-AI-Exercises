Introduction to ML:

AI has two types:
 - Strong AI / Artificial General Intelligence: Mimicing every activity that human brain does. Eg. Robotics.
 - Weak AI or Narrow AI: Solve one problem at a time. For Example: Detection of cancer in patients. ML comes under weak AI


 Deep Learning is the sub part of ML. This is more advance algorithms.

 Objective of ML is to understand patterns, learn and give some outcomes. For example: Learn from symptoms and come to conclusion of what disease you have. Thus, ML includes pattern recognition.

 Why is it Important?

 Because it can help solve complex problems that humans cant solve alone. It helps in predictions with massive amount of computational abilities.

 What is important:
 Right Training Data, Right Algorithm

 Types of ML
 Supervised Learning - with labels
  - Classification: Cssification into particular buckets: eg. Default / No Default
  - Regression: Need to predict particular values
 Unsupervised Learning - without labels
  - Clustering 
  - Association (Market Basket analysis etc.)
